Visel -- Visualization for niedoida partial multipoles module

RATIONALE:

    With the aid of niedoida package one may calculate
    atomic partial multipoles.
    Although the algebraic description of the multipoles
    (as a set of numbers) is complete, it does not provide
    straightforward insight into the physical nature of the mutipoles.
    Visel is supposed to provide the insight
    by generating a graphical representation of the multiopoles.

INSTALLATION:

- Visel compilation is not a part of niedoida compilation.
- Compilation platform: Visel is intended to work on Ubuntu-like systems.
- Compiler: GCC8 (needs to provide <filesystem> header).
- Visel dependencies: Visel uses the niedoida's external_packages,
  and VTK (Visualization Tookit). The latter is not provided by
  the Visel build system.
- VTK is a very popular high-level wrapper for OpenGL.
  On Ubuntu-like system VTK may be installed from the system repo:
  > apt install libvtk7-dev
- Viesel compilation:
  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  > make

USAGE:

  Visel is a simple post-processing tool.
  It it launched using CLI (in terminal).
  A niedoida output file has to be provided as an CLI argument:
  > niedoida $PATH_TO_NIEDOIDA_INPUT_FILE
  > visel $PATH_TO_NIEDOIDA_OUTPUT_FILE

  The full synopis:
  visel [-l] [-s] <PATH_TO_NIEDOIDA_OUTPUT_FILE>
  visel -h

  Options:
   -l  Use Lowdin population analysis instead of Mulliken population analysis (default is Mulliken).
   -s  Use standard (molecule) orientation instead of input orientation analysis (default is input).

  Note:
  The niedoia input file has to contain the following options turned on:
  ```
